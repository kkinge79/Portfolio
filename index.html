  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>
    Hello! my name is Kagan and i enjoy working seeing how computers work and building applications. My interest in software engineering started in 2013 when i was always thinking of new apps to invent. Delving into computer languages, seeing how they worked, helped me find my calling.

   In 2021, I had the privilege of attending the SEI course at Generaly Assembly. After an intense three months attending this class I am proud to call myself a software engineer.
